# Celestia 2 (Korolev)

## Contribute
```bash
$ npm i
# pnpm also works

$ npm run dev
# Use npm run sass:FILENAME for live sass compiler

$ npm run build
```

## The Name

V1 was called *Galileo* since he made the first Telescope and let us see Beyond the atmosphere
V2 is therefore called *Korolev* since he designed the first rocket and took us there

## Plans

- Convert to SvelteKit
- Add postcss for vendor prefixes (autoprefixer)
- Fetch any very large data files during build, don't ship. Ex Astronimical Events.
